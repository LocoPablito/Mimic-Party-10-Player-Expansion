# 10 Player Expansion for Mimic Party

**Runtime 1.1.4 · by arribbaa**

Up to **10 total players** in private Classic and Versus lobbies. Versus keeps the game's RED/BLUE selection: the mod does not impose equal teams or a separate five-player quota per side.

## Requirements

- [BepInEx Pack for Mimic Party](https://www.nexusmods.com/mimicparty/mods/3) **1.0.2**
- [Mimic Party Modding Core](https://www.nexusmods.com/mimicparty/mods/2) **1.0.0**
- Windows x64 / Steam / IL2CPP build listed in [Compatibility](https://github.com/LocoPablito/Mimic-Party-10-Player-Expansion/blob/main/COMPATIBILITY.md)

The main ZIP contains the Expansion only. Install both requirements separately.

## Installation / update

1. Close Mimic Party.
2. Install/update BepInEx Pack 1.0.2 in the folder containing `Mimic Party.exe`.
3. Install Core 1.0.0 into the same folder.
4. Extract this Expansion ZIP there; it adds/replaces `BepInEx/plugins/MimicParty10PlayerExpansion.dll`.
5. Launch normally through Steam and allow interop generation to finish when required.

## Features and settings

Classic and Versus share the configured **total** capacity, default 10. After a successful start, close the game and edit:

`BepInEx/config/com.arribbaa.mimicparty.10playerexpansion.cfg`

```ini
[Multiplayer]
MaxPlayers = 10
```

Allowed range: **6–10**. Values outside it are clamped.

Runtime 1.1.4 explicitly recognizes the captured v0.2.33 GameAssembly fingerprint. The same shared Classic/Versus capacity helper remains present exactly once with stock behavior Classic 5 / Versus 4:

`33 C0 83 F9 01 0F 95 C0 83 C0 04 C3`

On v0.2.33 the helper is located at RVA `0x1FCA310`; the actual runtime patch begins at RVA `0x1FCA315`. The patch remains signature-based, fail-closed to known builds, and performs its live 10/10/10 helper self-check before declaring the Expansion active.

The Expansion also installs the existing playback voice-isolation and rematch keep-lobby hooks. The v0.2.33 generated interop assemblies retain all required reflected targets. Public room-browser behavior is not spoofed by directly editing remote `RoomListing` values.

## v0.2.33 live acceptance

A real Windows v0.2.33 session confirmed:

- Bootstrap/Core loaded successfully.
- Every required Expansion hook target resolved.
- Every Harmony hook installed.
- Shared native capacity patch applied.
- Capacity self-check returned **10 / 10 / 10**.
- Classic mode card displayed **Up to 10 players**.
- Versus mode card displayed **Up to 10 players**.
- Classic private lobby displayed **1/10**.

## Removal and troubleshooting

Close the game and remove only `BepInEx/plugins/MimicParty10PlayerExpansion.dll`. Keep Core/Pack if other mods use them. Native capacity changes are in memory and disappear when the process exits.

Unrecognized game version or loader failure: do not force the patch; check `BepInEx/LogOutput.log`.
